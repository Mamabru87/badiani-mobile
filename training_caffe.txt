HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?
Remove the portafilter from the shower head
Flash the shower head. Do so by pressing the flush button. This passage is very important  
Knock out the old coffee and wipe the basket with a dry towel.
Dose the  freshly ground coffee.
Level the ground coffee in the basket.
Tamp the ground coffee.
Wipe clean the portafilter flaps and spouts.
Lock the portafilter in the grouphead.
Extract the coffee immediately.
Time shot.
Immediate serving.
TIPS & TRICKS 
Only use cups that are kept dry and hot on top of the coffee machine, it won't cool down espresso as quickly as a  
cold cup would.
If several coffees are made with the same order, espresso should be made last as it cannot stay as long as other 
coffees.
Ideally it should be served within the first 10 seconds after brewing is completed.
If espresso grind and extraction time is not in a range, remake coffee, adjust grinder if needed until it comes out 
within range.

MACCHIATO - SINGLE  & DOUBLE
Macchiato, sometimes called espresso  macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink 
with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted", so the literal 
translation of caffè macchiato is "stained coffee" or "marked coffee"
HOW DOES IT LOOK?
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?

Follow the single espresso preparation steps straight into the 2oz espresso cup for the single and 8oz cup for 
the double. While the espresso is brewing:  
Fill the milk jug up to the bottom of the spout.
Place the steam wand just below the surface of the milk and turn the steam on fully.
Stretch the milk: Keep the wand just below the surface and move to increase the volume of milk. You  
will need to slowly move the jug down as the milk takes in more air. Allow the milk to almost gain 
another third in volume.
Stop when the temperature reaches 65oC (140oF).
Tap the jug on a hard surface to disperse the larger bubbles in the foam, and swirl until the milk turns 
shiny.
Pouring: Tilt your cup so the espresso reaches the edge and pour carefully directly into the cup. You 
can also use the tea spoon to add 1 spoon of foam from the jug directly into the cup.
TIPS & TRICKS 
Do not fill the cup with milk unless specifically asked by the customer. You can always add more, but not 
remove.
Using the smallest jug you have as making milk for macchiato will always mean waste of milk as you'll use only  
the foam from the top.

FLAT WHITE
A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and 
a glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, 
therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing 
the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.

HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?
Follow double espresso preparation steps in an 8oz cup. While the espresso is brewing:
Fill the milk jug up to the bottom of the spout.
Place the steam wand just below the surface of the milk and turn the steam on fully.
Stretch the milk: Keep the wand just below the surface and move to increase the volume of milk. Be 
careful not to incorporate too much air.
After approximately 3 seconds, move the wand deeper into the jug (about halfway) and slightly to the 
side to create a whirlpool effect. This incorporates the foamed milk with the steamed milk. When the 
temperature reaches 65oC (140oF), it’s ready.
Polish the milk: Next, you will need to remove the air bubbles so tap the jug on a hard surface to 
disperse them. Swirl the jug until the milk turns shiny.
Pouring: Start pouring from the spout slowly at a height of 2 inches and lower your jug as you reach 
the second half of the cup.
TIPS & TRICKS 
If a customer asks for cortado, it will be 3/4 milk filled flat white.

LATTE - REGULAR  & LARGE
A latte or caffè latte is a milk coffee that boasts a silky layer of foam as a real highlight to the drink.
A true latte will be made up of espresso, steamed milk and a final, thin layer of frothed milk on top.
These elements combined result in a balanced milky coffee that possesses an aesthetically pleasing look and a 
smooth texture.

Pouring: Start pouring from the spout slowly at a height of 2 inches and lower your jug as you reach 
the second half of the cup.
TIPS & TRICKS 
My milk is screaming! What am I doing wrong? The steam wand is positioned too deep in the jug and unable to 
create foam. Move your wand closer to the milk surface.
Frothing the milk takes too long and the texture is just not right? Not enough pressure in the steam arm. Make 
sure that the steam is fully turned on when frothing and that all the holes are clear from blockages. To prevent 
clogging up, remember to wipe and purge the steam wand before and after every use.
If a customer's order contains syrup, add 2 pumps of syrup before brewing espresso into the cup.

CAPPUCCINO -  REGULAR & LARGE
A cappuccino is the perfect balance of  espresso, steamed milk and foam. This 
coffee is all about the structure and the  even splitting of all elements into equal 
thirds.
An expertly made cappuccino should be rich, but not acidic and have a mildly sweet flavouring from the milk. 
And, because the milk is not actually mixed in it gives the espresso a stronger flavour.
HOW DOES IT LOOK?
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?
Follow single espresso preparation steps in an 8oz cup for the single and 12oz cup for the double. While the 
espresso is brewing:
Fill the milk jug up to the bottom of the spout.

Tap the jug on a hard surface to disperse the larger bubbles in the foam, and swirl until the milk turns 
shiny.

Pouring: Tilt your cup so the espresso reaches the edge and pour carefully directly into the cup.
Dust some chocolate powder as a standard. and serve with a smile always together with a spoon and 
saucer.
TIPS & TRICKS 
Always ask if customer would like chocolate powder on top, some love it, some not so it's always better to ask 
first. If anyone asks for a dry or extra dry cappuccino, be prepared to use a bigger jug in order to create more 
foam.
Too many big air bubbles? The tip of the steam wand is placed too high when frothing and incorporating too 
much air. Try moving your wand just below the milk surface.
If customers order contains syrup, add 2 pumps of syrup before brewing espresso into the cup.
